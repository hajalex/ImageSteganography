# Steganography
The field of information security is regarded as being essential in the digital world, and its demand is growing daily.
One of the security measures used when exchanging information is cryptography.
The goal of cryptography is to conceal communication, in the sense that it conceals information in a digital medium to avoid raising suspicions about the presence of information there.

# Steganography in image
is the process of concealing private information or messages within digital images without changing their exterior appearance.
Steganography in photos primarily aims to hide the presence of the hidden data while preserving the usability and quality of the image.

This procedure includes modifying the RGB values or the least significant bits (LSB) of the pixels of a digital image in order to embed information, typically plaintext, into the image files.
Since it affects the tiniest amount of information in a pixel and is not visible to humans, the modifications are made in a way that does not significantly alter the image's quality or appearance.
